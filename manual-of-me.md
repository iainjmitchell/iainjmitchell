## The basics you should know about me are ...

It is important for me to recieve feedback that is specific and timely.  I prefer in-person feedback, though happy to recieve written feedback too especially if this gets it to me quicker.

I always start the day around 8am and aim to finish around 4pm.  The first part of my day is dedicated to reviewing my weekly objectives, meditating and my daily 10 mins of reading.

I don't work after hours and I never install work slack or email on my personal devices.

## Communication Channels ...

## You’ll convince me to get on board by ...
Making a really clear case with evidence/data behind it and giving me time to contemplate.

## Beyond work, I’m really passionate about ...

One of my former bands has a [few tracks on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3mKSIB6EHXwbsUIwXZqTXv?si=wGbXoCVUT0WSpklvdr_CtA&dl_branch=1)

Gardening - never thought I'd get into this but now grow lot's of veg and I have a greenhouse.  We've also recently got chickens, so our house is gradually turning into a farm.
