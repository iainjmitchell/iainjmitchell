# Manual of me

## The best way to give me feedback is â€¦
It is important for me to recieve feedback that is specific and timely.  I prefer in-person feedback, though happy to recieve written feedback too especially if this gets it to me faster.

I really struggle with second-hand feedback as I find the inability to ask clarifying questions really frustrating.
